    "Ultimately, both models achieved extremely high performance, but the DecisionTreeClassifier slightly outperformed the KNeighborsClassifier model across all key metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision. It also showed marginally better recall on challenging classes like rope jumping and transient activities. Given these consistent advantages, the DecisionTreeClassifier is the better choice for this recognizing activities from the activity dataset."
